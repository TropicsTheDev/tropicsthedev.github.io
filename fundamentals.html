                        <h4>Closed Guard</h4>
                        <p>The closed guard is a defensive position in which the grappler on the bottom traps the
                            attacking grappler between his or her legs. By doing so, the attacker’s movement is
                            restricted, allowing the defender to launch sweeps and attacks of their own. A key point of
                            using the closed guard is to try and restrict the attackers moon. </p>

                        <p>In the half guard, the defending grappler user their legs to trap a single leg of the
                            attacker. While the attacker is granted more freedom of movement, the defender still has
                            access to a wide variety of counter attacks. </p>

                        <p>Open guard is possibly the most dynamic defensive positions in Jiu Jitsu. The attacking
                            grappler has much more freedom of movement. Because of this, the defender must control
                            distance in order to effective off balance their opponent </p>

                        <p>The mount is an control point in which the attacker sits on their opponent’s upper body. This
                            is a very dominate position that allows the attacker to set up join locks and chokes.</p>

                        <h4>Side Control</h4>
                        <p>In the side control, a grappler lays perpendicular to their opponent’s body, and uses their
                            body
                            weight to restrict their opponent’s movement. This type of controls allows the attacking
                            grappler to block the hips of the grappler on the bottom.</p>

                        <h4>Back Mount</h4>
                        <p>Back mount is a very strong control that is often used to set up chokes. In this control, a
                            grappler puts their legs around the back of their opponent, and uses their arms to control
                            the
                            upper body. There are a variety of ways to use this position, but the main benefit is the
                            ability to control an severely restrict an opponent’s movement. </p>

                        <h4>Chokes</h4>
                        <p>A choke or strangle, is an attack that applies pressure to the neck. Some chokes are
                            designed to
                            cut off the oxygen from the opponent. Other chokes restrict blood flow through the neck.
                            Chokeholds, if held long enough, can render an opponent unconscious. </p>

                        <h4>Armlocks</h4>
                        <p>An armlock is any attack designed to hyperextend an opponent’s arm. This is typically
                            done to
                            the
                            joints in the elbows or shoulders. By creating a fulcrum point, leverage is used to
                            apply
                            the
                            correct pressure to the exposed limb.</p>

                        <h4>Leglocks</h4>
                        <p>Leg attacks are becoming more and more popular in modern Jiu Jitsu. Similar to armlocks,
                            leg
                            locks are attacks to the joins of the leg such as the ankles and knees. For beginner’s
                            it’s
                            safe
                            to start with attacks to the ankles. More advanced leg lock’s can be learned as a
                            grappler
                            gains
                            experience, however, these techniques have a higher risk of injury.</p>
