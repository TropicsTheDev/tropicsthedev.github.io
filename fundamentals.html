                    <h4>Leglocks</h4>
                    <p>Leg attacks are becoming more and more popular in modern Jiu Jitsu. Similar to armlocks, leg locks are attacks to the joins of the leg such as the ankles and knees. For beginner’s it’s safe to start with attacks to the ankles. More advanced leg lock’s can be learned as a grappler gains experience, however, these techniques have a higher risk of injury.</p>
